Schoolbox is a Melbourne-based development and infrastructure company that predominantly produces and manages a fully feature-complete Learning Management System (LMS) for schools from Kindergarten to Year 12. Schools implement Schoolbox’s LMS either through on-premises infrastructure maintained by the school, or via Schoolbox’s own infrastructure (acting as Software as a Service [SaaS]).

This includes the holistically across the fleet and by individuals servers. The dashboard is vital for the tracking and diagnostics for issues that occur with services provided, as well as observing system and package versions which are being utilized across the server fleet.
